# Metaphor ReFantazio Synthesis Calculation

This personal project is a simple online tool to be used when playing _Metaphor: ReFantazio_. It was inspired by the online fusions calculators that others have created for the _Persona_ and _SMT_ games. _Metaphor: Refantazio_ is lacking a menu area where it's possible to view all active synthesis skills on one screen. While playing I found planning party compositions in-game was often tedious or repetetive due to the necessary backtracking, so this project was created to help assist with that. Lineage and Archetype can be selected by the user, and the results will display a list of all the active Synthesis skills for the selected party composition.
